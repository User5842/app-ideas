# RobCo Messaging

AKA, a simple chat application using Socket.IO.

Work in progress as of (June 6, 2022), but I wanted to push something up for the night 🌙

## Homework

- [x] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- [] Add support for nicknames.
- [] Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he/she presses enter.
- [] Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
- [] Show who’s online.
- [] Add private messaging.
